# Let's Make a Synth in C++!

This is a multi-part series about making a digital synthesizer in C++.

I have no prior experience in real-time audio, and I only know the basics
of digital synthesizers, so I'll be learning along the way.

Each part is designed to be a self-contained C++ executable, along with
a README file to explain the code.

To build and run the synth for a specific part:

```
cd partX_blah_blah_blah
./build.sh
build/synth
```
